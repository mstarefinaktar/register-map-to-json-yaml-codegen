# Register Map to JSON/YAML Code Generator

This repository provides a Python-based tool for converting C/C++ register
definitions into structured JSON and YAML register maps.

The project focuses on parsing generic, table-style register definitions from
C header files and transforming them into machine-readable formats that can be
consumed by higher-level tooling. The goal is to bridge low-level firmware
definitions with validation, configuration, and documentation workflows while
maintaining a clean and extensible architecture.

Rather than exposing real hardware data, this repository demonstrates the
**conversion approach, parsing logic, and code-generation design** in a
confidentiality-safe manner.

## Key Features
- Parses C/C++-style register definition tables
- Generates structured JSON and YAML register maps
- Preserves essential register metadata (name, address, access, size)
- Clean separation between parsing and output generation
- Designed to be NDA-safe and easily extensible

---

## Supported Output Formats
- **JSON** – for tooling, automation, and validation pipelines  
- **YAML** – for human-readable configuration and inspection  

Both formats are generated from the same internal register model to ensure
consistency.

---

## Typical Use Cases
- Firmware configuration and tooling
- Register-level simulators and emulators
- Validation and diagnostic frameworks
- Embedded software utilities
- Hardware–software interface modeling

---

## How It Works
1. Reads a C header file containing generic register definitions
2. Uses pattern-based parsing to extract register metadata
3. Builds an internal register representation
4. Emits equivalent JSON and YAML register maps
5. Produces outputs ready for integration into external tools

---

## Design Philosophy
- Focus on **automation and abstraction**, not hardcoded data
- Keep parsing logic generic and reusable
- Avoid exposing proprietary or confidential register maps
- Enable straightforward extension to other formats (e.g., CSV, Markdown)
- Maintain clarity and maintainability over one-off scripting

    ## Examples
The `examples/` directory contains a dummy register definition header along
with corresponding JSON and YAML outputs generated by the tool. These files
are provided solely to demonstrate the expected input format and output
structure and do not represent any real hardware register maps.
